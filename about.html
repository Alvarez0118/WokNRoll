  <h2>How Bea's Began</h2>
<p>Bea's Wok N Roll began back in 1990 shortly after Bea and her husband immigrated to America from Vietnam. It was a hard time for them financially, but Bea wanted to bring something to Vietnamese to America. She wanted to show her culture to her new home and share her family style cooking with everyone in town. This year marks Bea's 28th year serving DeKalb county. </p>
<p>It wasn't long before Bea had gained a reputaion as one of the most delicious and authentic vietnamese restaurants in the county. She puts love into everything she cooks and it shows. She treats her customers like they were her own children, and will strike up a conversation with you even if it's been weeks since your last visit. She remember her customers and she makes sure they remember her food. She is famous for her Crab Rangoons. Folded in a unique shape and stuffed with far more filling that you expect from your normal rangoon, these delicious asian cuisine staple are to die for!</p>
